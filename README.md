# Raspberry Pints Tobor

This repository contains an install script for a very specific version of Raspberry Pints.  This version was shared by [Homebrewtalk](https://www.homebrewtalk.com) user [Tobor_8thMan](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/members/tobor_8thman.148827/) in [this post](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/version-2-release-raspberrypints-digital-taplist-solution.487694/page-116#post-8609646).

This script does not need to be downloaded or cloned to your local system; it is intended to be run by curling the script through a bash shell with sudo.  You may use either of these commands:

`curl -fsSL install.rpints.com | sudo bash`

or

`curl -L raw.githubusercontent.com/lbussy/rpints-tobor/master/rpints_install.sh | sudo bash`

The former, much easier to type and remember, is merely a redirect hosted on my website to this script.

The script replicates and automates instructions provided by [Tobor_8thMan](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/members/tobor_8thman.148827/) in [this post](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/version-2-release-raspberrypints-digital-taplist-solution.487694/page-116#post-8611274).  When complete; this allows the user to access the application via the web page to complete setup.  It does not appear that the hardware setup has been updated or addressed in his package.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for or contributed to the Raspberry Pints package downloaded and installed by this helper script.  This script is being provided to help anyone who wants to avoid manual installation steps while using his version of Raspberry Pints.
